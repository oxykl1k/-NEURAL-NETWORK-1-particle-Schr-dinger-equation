# [NEURAL NETWORK] 1-particle Schrödinger equation
This neural network (with three-sensy layers) is solving the 1-particle Schrödinger equation, using TensorFlow. Matplotlib graph shows us the wave-function visualization, probability density and it`s position on OX. Here used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
